Once when I was a little boy I enjoyed Kermit the Frog on Sesame Street... Or was it The Muppets? Or didn't The Muppets live on Sesame Street? I don't remember. Either way, he was a fun silly guy, who seemed to be the real leader of the pack. He had a hot girlfriend in Miss Piggy. And his best friend was a giant bird. He could cheer up the Grouch, and calm down the Cookie Monster. In all, he was a great guy who just minded his own business.
